# timekeeper
Some simple time-tracking for billable hours

hourCounter.py - Enter your start time and break time in minutes and get your billable hours to the time of running
overtimeCalc.py - Enter the number of hours worked this month and get amount of overtime worked to COB of previous day. Optional argument lets you calculate overtime if you stopped working right now.
timekeeper.py - GUI which lets the user enter start and stop times for various projects. Saves JSON for the month and lets user run report for billing projects.
plotly_practice.py - Some testing of the Gantt charg functionality in plotly. May get incorporated into timekeeper at somepoint.
Note: Most of this is hardcoded for my specific needs. Feel free to help me make it work more generally.
